# **ChitChat Bot**

The Website Assistant ChitChat Bot is a chatbot designed to assist users on a website or university club by providing relevant answers to their questions. In this scenario, it is for the Artificial Intelligence Club at Michigan State University.

Features
- The bot can answer questions related to the website or club.
- It can provide information about events, members, and membership details.
- The bot can engage users in casual conversation and provide a friendly chat experience.
- A chat logging feature will keep track of messages and a periodic scan will allow for a more concise and updated model.

How to Use
The Website Assistant ChitChat Bot can be accessed through the chat icon on the website or club. Once clicked, the chatbot will greet the user and provide a prompt to start the conversation.
Users can then ask questions related to the website or club, and the bot will respond with relevant answers. As of now, only the model is finished and the front-end aspect of this feature is still WIP.
